# k_nearest_neighbour
Simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm

## Description
This implementation of the algorithm is a simple one: it "trains" the algorithm by loading a file (data_points.txt) which contains 30 distinct points (x and y coordinates) along with the group each point belongs to (currently there are three (3) distinct groups). Following that, the program will prompt the user to enter the x and y coordinates of a point and the cardinal number of the neighbouring points that need to be considered for the point in question to be classified.
